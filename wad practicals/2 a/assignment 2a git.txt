To create a repository and push your code to GitHub, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to the GitHub website (https://github.com) and log in to your account.
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository".
   - Enter a name for your repository, choose any desired settings, and click "Create repository".

2. Initialize a local Git repository:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where your code is located using the `cd` command.
   - Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:
     ```
     git init
     ```

3. Add your code to the repository:
   - Use the following command to add all the files in your code directory to the repository:
     ```
     git add .
     ```

4. Commit your changes:
   - Run the following command to commit your changes with a commit message:
     ```
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

5. Link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository:
   - Go to your GitHub repository's page and copy the repository's URL (ending with .git).
   - Run the following command to add the remote repository:
     ```
     git remote add origin <repository-url>
     ```
     Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL you copied.

6. Push your code to GitHub:
   - Finally, use the following command to push your code to the remote GitHub repository:
     ```
     git push -u origin master
     ```
     This command will push the code to the `master` branch of your repository.

After executing these steps, your code will be pushed to the GitHub repository, and you can view it on the GitHub website.
